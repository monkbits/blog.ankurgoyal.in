Right now, I’m in Pune, working for a product-based company as a software developer. Life is going very smoothly. I have a nice place to stay, a decent salary, and a promising start to my career. The people in my office are also nice. I want to maintain a positive mindset and contribute as much as possible to both others and myself.

Most of the time, people hesitate to share personal details, and having some privacy is essential. I don’t plan to share everything here, but I do want to share some aspects of my journey in the IT field. I hope that over time, people will recognize and connect with me.
